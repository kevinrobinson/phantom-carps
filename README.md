tinkering with radar charts to look at data points in low-dimensional space


### what is this
from tinkering with [code-dot-org/ml-activities](https://github.com/code-dot-org/ml-activities)

and visualizing the param space using this [radar chart](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/2015/10/different-look-d3-radar-chart.html) by Nadieh Bremer

and this [ridgeline chart](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/ridgeline_basic.html) from Yan Holtz


### example
this example is with adding noise up to 50% of the value of the dimension, with 10 samples.  reloading shows another example at the same noise param:
